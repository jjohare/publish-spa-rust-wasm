## Conclusion

The Rust WASM port demonstrates **excellent technical potential** with significant performance improvements over the original implementation. The architecture is sound, the code is well-organized, and Rust's safety guarantees provide a solid foundation.

However, **critical security vulnerabilities, insufficient testing, and technical debt** prevent immediate production deployment. With focused effort over 4-6 weeks, the project can reach production quality and deliver substantial value.

### Verdict: 🟡 Proceed with Caution

**Recommended Path**: Invest 4 weeks in addressing critical issues and testing before production deployment. The performance gains (6-10x) justify the development effort, but security and quality cannot be compromised.
